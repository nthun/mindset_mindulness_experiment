               importance of effort. Results showed significant correlations
               between students who received more ``empathic messages'' and
               those who were ``more confident,'' ``more patient,'' exhibited
               ``higher'' levels of ``interest,'' and ``valued'' math knowledge

               to get more problems correct on their first attempt but valued
               math knowledge less and had lower ``posttest scores.'' Students
               who received more ``success/failure'' messages tended to make

              test the reliability and the structural and convergent validity
              of the refined version of the ER11 Ego-resiliency scale. In Study
              1 we used a factor analytical approach to assess structural
              validity and to identify factors of Ego-resiliency. Comparing
              alternative factor-structures, a hierarchical model was chosen
              including three factors: Active Engagement with the World (AEW),
              Repertoire of Problem Solving Strategies (RPSS), and Integrated
              Performance under Stress (IPS). In Study 2, the convergent and
              divergent validity of the ER11 scale and its factors and their

              that resiliency is a double-faced construct, with one function to
              keep the personality system stable and intact, and the other
              function to adjust the personality system in an adaptive way to
              the dynamically changing environment. The stability function is
              represented by the RPSS and IPS components of ER. Their
              relationship pattern is similar to other constructs of
              resilience, e.g. the Revised Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale
              (R-CD-RISC). The flexibility function is represented by the unit
              of RPSS and AEW components. In Study 3 we tested ER11 on a

              the prevention and treatment of youth psychopathology, carrying
              potential to improve the scalability and accessibility of youth
              psychological services. However, existing SSIs have conferred
              greater benefits for youths with anxiety, compared to depression
              or comorbid problems, and their effects have generally waned over
              time - particularly for follow-ups exceeding 3 months. METHOD: To
              help address these discrepancies, we tested whether a novel SSI
              teaching growth mindset of personality (the belief that
              personality is malleable) could reduce depression and anxiety and
              strengthen perceived control in high-risk adolescents (N = 96,
              ages 12-15). At baseline, youths were randomized to receive a
              30-min, computer-guided growth mindset intervention or a
              supportive-therapy control. Youths and parents reported youth
              anxiety and depressive symptoms, and youths reported their levels
              of perceived control, at baseline and across a 9-month follow-up
              period. RESULTS: Compared to the control program, the mindset
              intervention led to significantly greater improvements in
              parent-reported youth depression (d = .60) and anxiety (d = .28),
              youth-reported youth depression (d = .32), and youth-reported
              perceived behavioral control (d = .29) by 9-month follow-up.
              Intervention effects were nonsignificant for youth-reported
              anxiety, although 9-month effect sizes reached the
              small-to-medium range (d = .33). Intervention group youths also
              experienced more rapid improvements in parent-reported
              depression, youth-reported depression, and perceived behavioral
              control across the follow-up period, compared to control group
              youths. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest a promising, scalable SSI

               show that optimal and high self-esteem are different from each
               other. High self-esteem can be fragile or secure depending upon
               the extent to which it is defensive or genuine, contingent or
               true, unstable or stable, and discrepant or congruent with
               implicit (nonconscious) feelings of self-worth. Optimal
               self-esteem is characterized by qualities associated with
               genuine, true, stable, and congruent (with implicit self-esteem)
               high self-esteem. A second major goal is to present a
               conceptualization of the construct of authenticity. I propose
               that authenticity as an individual difference construct may be
               particularly important in delineating the adaptive features of
               optimal self-esteem. Authenticity can be characterized as the
               unobstructed operation of one's true, or core, self in one's
               daily enterprise. I argue that authenticity has 4 components:
               awareness, unbiased processing, action, and relational. Initial
               data pertaining to these components are highly encouraging.
               Finally, I discuss some implications of the fragile versus
               secure high self-esteem distinction for narcissism, defensive

              boredom proneness, an individual's propensity to become bored, is
              associated with negative clinical and life outcomes. This study
              evaluated dispositional mindfulness, a personality characteristic
